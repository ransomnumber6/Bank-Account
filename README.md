# Bank-Account
Simple bank account using Java

First somewhat complicated program that I worked on, not all the worked presented here is my own. Much of it was provided by Kurt Marley a CSC teacher at Glendale community college.

This program will ask for user input rearding values to be deposited, withdrawn or borrowed. The output will either produce the values contained in the bank account after the transaction has been completed or will throw an exception error if the required action is impossible to complete based on the state of the bank account.
